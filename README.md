## Configuration

There's only one option, which is to show values for spike dodges. You can change this in the `BepInEx/config/net.zachava.showpreciseaccuracytext.cfg` file by changing `ShowSpikeAccuracy = false` to `ShowSpikeAccuracy = true`

The comment in that file explains when the value will be shown.
